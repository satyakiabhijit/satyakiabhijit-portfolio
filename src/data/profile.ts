    bio: `I'm Abhijit Satyaki, a passionate Full-Stack Web Developer, Machine Learning enthusiast, and IT undergraduate at Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College. I specialize in building responsive, user-centric web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, while also exploring the power of data-driven solutions through machine learning.

During my academic journey, I completed a research internship at Haldia Institute of Technology, where I worked on optimizing sensory data accumulation for IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) systems using energy-efficient compressed sensing techniques. This experience deepened my understanding of both embedded systems and intelligent data processing.

Beyond web development, I am actively expanding my skills in data science and machine learning, focusing on areas like data reconstruction, predictive modeling, and optimization algorithms. I enjoy tackling complex problems and continuously learning new technologies to build impactful, scalable digital solutions.

Whether it's developing scalable web platforms, creating smart data-driven applications, or contributing to research in emerging tech fields, I bring creativity, dedication, and collaborative spirit to every project.`,
